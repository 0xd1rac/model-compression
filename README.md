## Road Map

### Pruning 
#### Part 1: Learning about different pruning criterion
- [ ] Train a Resnet-50 on CIFAR-10 dataset and get a baseline accuracy
- [ ] Implement global pruning on trained Resnet-50 (Magnitude-based)
- [ ] Implement layer-wise pruning on trained Resnet-50 (Magnitude-based)
- [ ] Implement global pruning on trained Resnet-50 (Scaling-based)
- [ ] Implement layer-wise pruning on trained Resnet-50 (Scaling-based)
- [ ] Implement global pruning on trained Resnet-50 (Second-Order-based)
- [ ] Implement layer-wise pruning on trained Resnet-50 (Second-Order-based)
- [ ] Implement global pruning on trained Resnet-50 (Percentage-of Zero-based)
- [ ] Implement global layer-wise on trained Resnet-50 (Percentage-of Zero-based)
- [ ] Implement global pruning on trained Resnet-50 (Regression-based)
- [ ] Implement global layer-wise on trained Resnet-50 (Regression-based)

#### Part 2: Learning about different pruning schedules and finetuning
  * 1. Set up the Environment *
  - [ ] Train a baseline VGG16 model on CIFAR-10
  - [ ] Set up your dataset (e.g., CIFAR-10 or CIFAR-100).
  - [ ] Download or implement the Resnet50 Model
        
  * 2. Train the Baseline Model *
